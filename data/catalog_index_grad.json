The scope of Derrida's thinking is incomprehensible.  As a person of prayers and tears, Derrida was a prominent philosopher-theologian/theologian-philosopher who never kept his political and ethical passion separate from the uninterrupted theological, philosophical reflections.  Derrida audaciously fought against all form of apartheid and exclusion, wherever they took place; and passionately and consistently spoke out for justice, compassion, and hospitality.  This curse examines several theopolitical issues in Derrida's thinking such as deconstruction, justice, religion, hospitality, cosmopolitanism, and forgiveness."

The perspective of the course will be from the point of view of senior administrators who would typically have responsibility for finance or some financial functions in an institution but would not be a senior financial officer, i.e. dean, provost, etc.  The plan of this course is to develop new understandings of the nature of higher education finance by exploring financial challenges, what can be done to negotiate them, and how financial decisions impact educational quality, equity, accountability, and sustainability.  The course will explore topics of financial policy, government support of higher education, financial aid, and economics of higher education, human capital theory, and privatization in higher education.",

The pace of change is accelerating not only from our advancing technology, but also from world population growth, economic growth, and increasingly frequent collisions between expanding human demands and the limits of the Earth's natural systems.  It appears that catastrophe looms ahead unless major changes are made in a short period of time.  Or does it?  Fortunately, human beings are capable of changing their behavior and values, which are then reflected in changes in national and international priorities.  Such changes happen when people are confronted with new information or new experiences.  This is a discussion and debate style course.  The objective is to introduce students to controversies in environmental policy and science.  The readings, which represent the arguments of leading environmentalists, scientists, and policymakers, reflect a variety of viewpoints and have been selected for their liveliness and substance.  They are organized topically around major areas of study within environmental studies, and include environmental ethics, water resources, energy, global climate change, and population."

What lessons are there in the American experience?  General Washington's startling words in 1783 express his anxiety for the problems of American state-building and give the title to a course that will examine the origins of those problems in the protest to British imperialism, the War for Independence, and the post-war challenges leading to the creation of the federal structure under the Constitution."

The claim by many parapsychologists is that these paranormal occurrences have been studied with rigorous research methods, and that there is considerable evidence to support their existence.  This course will weigh the evidence for parapsychology by tracing the history of psychical research from the dawn of spiritualism to the present day use of the ganzfeld technique.  We will discuss the careers of famous psychics as well as the contributions of many noted parapsychologists.  The methods and results from parapsychological studies will be evaluated in the context of the approaches used by researchers in the natural sciences.  This course will address the following important issues: are testimonials useful evidence to support the existence of these phenomena; do fraudulent claims preclude acceptance of the field; can parapsychological research findings be replicated; do probability and chance help explain paranormal events; how have magicians and skeptics affected the perception of parapsychology in the scientific community and the general public.  The objective of this course is to present perspectives from both believers and skeptics such that in the end, each student can make up his/her own mind as to the strength of the evidence."

Rather than living in harmony with nature indigenous peoples typically altered their environments, often extensively. In some cases, the results of these modifications are still visible today.  This course examines the multiple ways indigenous peoples of the Americas modified their natural environments past and present. Specific themes include: settlement impact on the environment; the role of population growth and decline; environmental perception through place naming; indigenous mapping of their environments; and, environmental modification through agriculture (the creation of Amazonian dark soils, terracing, raised fields, etc.). Finally, the course will analyze and evaluate current efforts in the Americas to preserve the environment by protecting indigenous lands through participatory mapping."

The pace of change is accelerating not only from our advancing technology, but also from world population growth, economic growth, and increasingly frequent collisions between expanding human demands and the limits of the Earth's natural systems.  It appears that catastrophe looms ahead unless major changes are made in a short period of time.  Or does it?  Fortunately, human beings are capable of changing their behavior and values, which are then reflected in changes in national and international priorities.  Such changes happen when people are confronted with new information or new experiences.  This is a discussion and debate style course.  The objective is to introduce students to controversies in environmental policy and science.  The readings, which represent the arguments of leading environmentalists, scientists, and policymakers, reflect a variety of viewpoints and have been selected for their liveliness and substance.  They are organized topically around major areas of study within environmental studies, and include environmental ethics, water resources, energy, global climate change, and population."

Students go on to investigate theories of translation as applied to a wide range of different genres of texts and communication situations; in addition, they review critically the varied and most valued practices of translating.  During the course, then, the students will work with one another on individual or group translation projects of their choosing.

This biting satire targeting Jews and Muslims has left deep sores that have never completely healed due to the constant 'picking at.'

Workshop implies that the products of our minds as well as the writing process are our chief concerns - concerns that will encourage a persistent questioning of everyday assumptions about creative-non-fiction, meaning, structure, form, voice, one, etc.  Student work will be discussed in both workshops and conferences.  In class we will do thought and writing experiments, share work, and discuss problems and possibilities of the imagination and creative writing.

The emergence of an increasingly interconnected global economy marked by increasing economic integration and creation of a borderless world, has posed new challenges for global governance and the autonomy of nation states.  Hence, another dimension of our nuanced world is that the manifestations of new primordial loyalties and cultural and identity anxieties threaten to tear the world apart.  At no other juncture in modern history was the world so connected, yet so divided by strife and conflict.  The emergence of global problems such as environmental degradation, spread of infectious diseases such as AIDS, the lingering problem of global hunger and genocide are among the pressing issues of the new century.  These developments would have an indelible impact on the emerging society of the 21st century.  This course is designed to provide a forum for analysis and discussion of these issues.  While the attempt is to dissect these issues primarily on their own terms, we would also discuss the challenges they pose to the United States and the global community."

The course, however, does not concentrate on Islamic theology; rather, the focus is on politics of Islam and how it molds political discourse and agenda.  After the study of origins and historical development of Islamic political theory, the focus would shift to explaining the use of post-World War II Islamic revival.  In this connection, the rise of Islamic militancy, the discourse of the Jihadi movement, the challenges before US foreign policy and global community, and the problematics of democratization in the Muslim world and the prospects for Islamic governments are discussed."

Although many people view marketing as an art and others regard it as science, this course views marketing as a combination of art and science to solve specific problems.  Students will learn concepts and will work hands-on with data and software tools for making decisions regarding segmentation and targeting, positioning, forecasting, new product and service design, and the elements of the marketing mix.

    "description": "the recognition of religious plurality could be the antidote to tensions, conflicts, genocide, and religious annihilation based on the religious superiorism by a dominant religion in today's world.  Affirming the existence of \"other\" religions requires one to fundamentally re-examine and re-conceptualize the nature and vision of Christian ministries and theologies.  The primary expectation for students in this course is that students will finish the course with an in-depth understanding of the discourses and practices of other religions than Christianity.  This course deals with such complex issues as religious orientalism, a geopolitical dimension of multiple realities of \"world religions,\" some understanding and Christian theological discourses on \"other\" religions, which are interconnected to the conceptual frameworks of Theo-logy, Christology, and soteriology in Christian theological and ministerial formation and practice."
