Creativity and innovation are key drivers for economic activity and wealth generation, as well as for individual and community well-being. Entrepreneurs in growing businesses, large firms, the social sector and government are upsetting the status quo, altering accepted ways of doing things, transforming industries and finding meaning for themselves and those with whom they work. This course focuses on two key themes. One is creativity and innovation and the other is the pursuit of opportunity, which considers the skills and know-how required to exploit opportunity and create social and economic value. Students will learn to recognize their own creative talents, apply creative problem-solving techniques to tasks and challenges, (3) recognize and remove blocks to innovation, and (4) understand and apply the elements in the entrepreneurial process.",

This is also supplemented by developing students' critical thinking skills through in-depth analysis of financial decisions from a managerial perspective. This course will help students better understand the key issues that managers face when they make investment decisions, including technical issues, such as knowledge of cash flows, time-value of money, valuation principles, but also big picture issues, examining what the sources of value creation are, how to deal with managerial biases and estimation uncertainty, and how investment decisions must fit with the strategic vision of the firm.",

      "description": "Prerequisites:  Enrollment in the MLA program. This course will examine how American literature from the 1800s to the present has explored the racial divide between African Americans and white authority.  We will achieve a broad historical and political perspective by reading a range of genres, including fiction, nonfiction, and poetry composed by black, white, and biracial authors, with the purpose of using the literary tradition as a lens through which we assess the contradictory nature of American democracy and the vulnerable position of African-Americans within it.  Our discussion will address slavery, abolition, segregation and Jim Crow laws, police brutality, the white gaze, white privilege, white guilt, cultural appropriation, racial passing, faith as propaganda, and the commonplace assumptions and fears about race, law enforcement, and national identity that have helped perpetuate the constraints of institutional racism in the United States.",

Words do hurt as we full know because language is neither innocuous nor value neutral, especially in the process of constructing identities.  Language's form as stereotype constructs and relects the representations of others.  Its discourse of difference and humiliation as an ethno-typing strategy presumes superiority of one ethnic group (e.g. Israel and Euro-American) over another.  And these stereotypes proliferate throughout culture and time via diverse media, including the Bible, itself a cultural artifact.  Probing the seams of the representation strategy of stereotyping in its diverse media, however, reveals the identity of 'self' reflected within 'other' while simultaneously ascribing a voice often left silenced to the 'other' in its own identity construction.  This course explores the representation process through stereotyping by means of paired ethic groups, past (e.g. Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Samaritans) and present (e.g. Native, Latina/o, Asian, and African Americans).",

From the Monroe Doctrine in 1823 to the military intervention in Haiti in 1994, the United States has asserted a leadership role in the hemisphere, often with little understanding of the impact its actions had on the less-powerful nations of Latin America.  Most of the course is devoted to the 20th Century, and major issues are examined from both the U.S. and Latin American perspectives.",

Rather than living in harmony with nature indigenous peoples typically altered their environments, often extensively. In some cases, the results of these modifications are still visible today.  This course examines the multiple ways indigenous peoples of the Americas modified their natural environments past and present. Specific themes include: settlement impact on the environment; the role of population growth and decline; environmental perception through place naming; indigenous mapping of their environments; and, environmental modification through agriculture (the creation of Amazonian dark soils, terracing, raised fields, etc.). Finally, the course will analyze and evaluate current efforts in the Americas to preserve the environment by protecting indigenous lands through participatory mapping.",

The pace of change is accelerating not only from our advancing technology, but also from world population growth, economic growth, and increasingly frequent collisions between expanding human demands and the limits of the Earth's natural systems.  It appears that catastrophe looms ahead unless major changes are made in a short period of time.  Or does it?  Fortunately, human beings are capable of changing their behavior and values, which are then reflected in changes in national and international priorities.  Such changes happen when people are confronted with new information or new experiences.  This is a discussion and debate style course.  The objective is to introduce students to controversies in environmental policy and science.  The readings, which represent the arguments of leading environmentalists, scientists, and policymakers, reflect a variety of viewpoints and have been selected for their liveliness and substance.  They are organized topically around major areas of study within environmental studies, and include environmental ethics, water resources, energy, global climate change, and population.",

It is in this sense that we will focus on music artists that have arisen from marginalized or edge areas of existential and cultural, social, national angst and that have given acute expression to the human experience.

Class discussions, readings, and audiovisuals focus on selected cases of religious movement in various regions of the world.  Topics include the roles of movement prophets, movements' processes of resocialization, and how cults and sects relate to broader struggles over meaning and social identity.  The student will gain critical insights into five major areas of inquiry into religious movements: 1) Conditions that lead to the rise of new religions, 2) how beliefs in end-of-the-world (millennialist) scenarios evolve, 3) dynamics of recruitment and conversion, 4) daily life inside religious movements, and 5) problems of doing research in the absolutist sectarian setting.",

We will explore the way sexism, heterosexism, genderism, racism, and classism function oppressively limiting possibilities for well-being in relationships as well as structurally and systemically and shaping the context of care, and we will develop personal and professional strategies for resisting their destructive effects.
