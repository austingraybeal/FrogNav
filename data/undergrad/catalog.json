However, love has never been as socially, politically, existentially, philosophically, and theologically decisive as it is in contemporary societies. Love becomes significant sources of the creative human power, and of the meaning of life.

Students are further introduced to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) through content-focused lab assignments, though no previous experience with GIS is required for this course.",

Dante's Comedy, produced during a period of rapid transition, is one of the great works of World literature and a foundational text for Medieval culture, both pagan and Christian.  In this course, we will study Dante's epic poem in its historical context and how it relates to our own world, given that The Divine Comedy is ultimately about an individual's search for meaning.  We will see how Dante's allegorical and mystical journey to God unfolds through a series of precise descriptions of characters, settings, and concrete episodes that comprise the vast world of the great narrative poem.  Students will gain a critical understanding of this literary masterpiece as well as the cultural context in which it was produced.

The claim by many parapsychologists is that these paranormal occurrences have been studied with rigorous research methods, and that there is considerable evidence to support their existence.  This course will weigh the evidence for parapsychology by tracing the history of psychical research from the dawn of spiritualism to the present day use of the ganzfeld technique.  We will discuss the careers of famous psychics as well as the contributions of many noted parapsychologists.  The methods and results from parapsychological studies will be evaluated in the context of the approaches used by researchers in the natural sciences.  This course will address the following important issues: are testimonials useful evidence to support the existence of these phenomena; do fraudulent claims preclude acceptance of the field; can parapsychological research findings be replicated; do probability and chance help explain paranormal events; how have magicians and skeptics affected the perception of parapsychology in the scientific community and the general public.

Words do hurt as we full know because language is neither innocuous nor value neutral, especially in the process of constructing identities.  Language's form as stereotype constructs and relects the representations of others.  Its discourse of difference and humiliation as an ethno-typing strategy presumes superiority of one ethnic group (e.g. Israel and Euro-American) over another.  And these stereotypes proliferate throughout culture and time via diverse media, including the Bible, itself a cultural artifact.  Probing the seams of the representation strategy of stereotyping in its diverse media, however, reveals the identity of 'self' reflected within 'other' while simultaneously ascribing a voice often left silenced to the 'other' in its own identity construction.  This course explores the representation process through stereotyping by means of paired ethic groups, past (e.g. Edomites, Moabites, Ammonites, and Samaritans) and present (e.g. Native, Latina/o, Asian, and African Americans).",

This course examines the multiple ways indigenous peoples of the Americas modified their natural environments past and present. Specific themes include: settlement impact on the environment; the role of population growth and decline; environmental perception through place naming; indigenous mapping of their environments; and, environmental modification through agriculture (the creation of Amazonian dark soils, terracing, raised fields, etc.).

It appears that catastrophe looms ahead unless major changes are made in a short period of time.  Or does it?  Fortunately, human beings are capable of changing their behavior and values, which are then reflected in changes in national and international priorities.  Such changes happen when people are confronted with new information or new experiences.  This is a discussion and debate style course.  The objective is to introduce students to controversies in environmental policy and science.  The readings, which represent the arguments of leading environmentalists, scientists, and policymakers, reflect a variety of viewpoints and have been selected for their liveliness and substance.

This course is an opportunity for students to take a pilgrimage into Catholic Christian identity across time and across the globe, primarily in those areas colonized by European kingdoms and nations.

The overall aim of the course is to deepen students' capacities for historical reflection on Catholic culture, beliefs, practices and institutions across the globe. Participants, whatever their religious identity (or lack thereof), will learn more of what it has meant historically to think, pray and live as Catholic Christians in the Majority World so that they can apply these insights to their own work in today's pluralistic context.",

Black, Indigenous, other people of color, working class, immigrant, women, and other marginalized groups bear the brunt of environmental problems in the United States and across the world, facing disproportionate impacts from things like air and water pollution, toxic chemicals, climate change, industrialization, and biodiversity loss. Why are certain groups systematically exposed to greater environmental burdens and fewer environmental amenities while other groups have access to clean air and water? What effect does this have on people's health and well-being? Who benefits from these inequalities and who makes decisions about environmental policies?

In turn, we explore how people work to remedy environmental problems. These lessons are applied to understanding, researching, and addressing contemporary environmental justice issues.",

A social psychological perspective emphasizes the decisions people make in provocative settings, or contexts that involve moments of truth.  In this vein, conformity appears in opposition to rebellion .  However, conformity can, and often does, imply some form of rebellion just as rebellion implies some form of conformity.  Both conformity and rebellion can become problematic, or linked to existential decisions to either act against habit, judgement, and moral standpoints.  Rebellion can be seen as an unwanted occurrence that threatens our preferred styles of life, requiring resolution through conformity; conformity can become seen as an impediment to a free society which, in order to salvage a sense of free choice, requires some form of rebellion.  Examination of the complex relationship between conformity and rebellion can sharpen our focus when considering, specifically, in what kind of society we wish to live.",
